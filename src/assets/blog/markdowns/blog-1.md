> ### Medium.com clone (called [Conduit](https://bright-centaur-dc348e.netlify.app/#/)) was built using Angular version 14 with Standalone Component.
### [Demo](https://bright-centaur-dc348e.netlify.app/#/)

This project was built to explore how **Angular 14 w/ Standalone Component** would look like in real project.

In this project, I also learnt how to **Unit testing with Jasmine**, **Building SSR Aplication with Universal**.

This project was not integrated with any API. I use **@ngneat/elf w/ Persist State** to store every data in **Local Storage**



# How it works

- All Components are authored with `standalone:true`
- Experimenting with `inject()` instead of traditional Constructor DI
- Using [@ngneat/elf](https://ngneat.github.io/elf/) as State Management solution

# Getting started

- `npm install`
- `npm start`
