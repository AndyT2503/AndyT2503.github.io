        Hello! My name is Tu Hoang. I'm 24. I'm a software engineer based in Ho
        Chi Minh city. I have 3 years of experience working with .NET Core and
        Angular. Currently, I work mainly with Angular.
      </p>
      <p>
        Out of work, I really like traveling. Whenever I have spare times, I
        will travel to somewhere and enjoy my life. My goal is to travel around
        Vietnam. I also hope that I can travel abroad and live in another
        country in 1 or 2 months.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, I'm a Senior Software Engineer at
        <a href="https://www.hcltech.com/" target="_blank">HCL Technology</a>.
        In the future, I want to become the Angular Google Developer Expert (GDE).
